# Python - Input/Output

This project focuses on managing input and output in Python, a fundamental aspect of programming that enables interaction with users and data manipulation. Through a series of exercises, we will explore various methods for reading and writing files, handling data in JSON format, and understanding the use of Python modules for efficient input/output operations. This project aims to enhance Python programming skills by applying I/O concepts while creating applications that can effectively process and save data.

## task

#### 0. Read file : function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

#### 1. Write to a file : function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written

#### 2. Append to a file : function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added

#### 3. To JSON string : Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)

#### 4. From JSON string to Object : function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string

#### 5. Save Object to a file : function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation

#### 6. Create object from a JSON file : function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”

#### 7. Load, add, save : script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file

#### 8. Class to JSON : function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object

#### 9. Student to JSON : class Student that defines a student

#### 10. Student to JSON with filter : def to_json(self, attrs=None)

#### 11. Student to disk and reload : def reload_from_json(self, json)

#### 12. Pascal's Triangle : that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle
