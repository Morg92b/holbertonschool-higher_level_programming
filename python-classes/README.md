# Python - Classes and Objects

This project focuses on the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python by creating and managing classes and objects. The goal is to understand key OOP concepts like encapsulation, methods, private attributes, and properties, while experimenting with practical examples.

## Content:

#### Square class: Defines a square with private attributes (size and position) and methods to validate, display, and calculate the area of a square.

#### Error Handling: Type and value validation for attributes through exceptions (TypeError, ValueError).

#### Public Methods:

- area(): Calculates the area of the square.
- my_print(): Prints the square using # characters.

#### Getter/Setter: Utilizes properties to manage the private attributes size and position.

## Learning Objectives:

Understand OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation, etc.).
Use private attributes to ensure data integrity.
Master Python properties to access and modify attributes.

## TASK:

#### 0. My first square : Create an empty Square class.

#### 1. Square with size : Add a private size attribute to the Square class.

#### 2. Size validation : Validate that size is a positive integer.

#### 3. Area of a square : Add a method to calculate the area of the square.

#### 4. Access and update private attribute : Use properties to access and modify size.

#### 5. Printing a square : Add a method to print the square using #.

#### 6. Coordinates of a square : Manage the square's position with a position attribute and validate the coordinates.
