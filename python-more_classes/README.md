# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Introduction :

Welcome to the Rectangle Class project! This project focuses on implementing a Rectangle class in Python, designed to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of rectangles. It leverages object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it an excellent resource for learning and practicing these concepts.

The Rectangle class allows you to create rectangle objects with defined width and height while ensuring that the dimensions are valid integers. It features various methods to compute essential properties like area and perimeter, as well as capabilities for comparing rectangle instances based on their sizes.

In addition to standard rectangle functionalities, this project includes class attributes for instance tracking and customizable string representations, enabling users to visualize their rectangles in a flexible manner. The class also supports the creation of square instances, reinforcing the relationship between squares and rectangles.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand object-oriented programming or an experienced developer seeking to refine your skills, this project offers practical insights into class design, error handling, and Python's robust capabilities.

Dive into the code, explore the functionalities, and discover how the Rectangle class exemplifies the principles of Python programming!

## TASK :

#### 0. Simple Rectangle

Created a basic Rectangle class with private attributes for width and height, allowing for the instantiation of rectangle objects.

#### 1. Real Definition of a Rectangle

Implemented property methods for width and height to retrieve and set values, ensuring they are integers and non-negative.

#### 2. Area and Perimeter

Added methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle, returning appropriate values based on the dimensions.

#### 3. String Representation

Defined string representation methods (**str** and **repr**) to provide a visual representation of the rectangle using the print symbol.

#### 4. Eval is Magic

Enhanced the **repr** method to return a string that can be used to recreate the rectangle instance using eval().

#### 5. Detect Instance Deletion

Implemented a custom message displayed when a rectangle instance is deleted, improving the class's user feedback.

#### 6. How Many Instances

Added a class attribute to keep track of the number of rectangle instances created and deleted, promoting better resource management.

#### 7. Change Representation

Allowed customization of the print symbol for string representation, enabling users to represent rectangles with different characters.

#### 8. Compare Rectangles

Introduced a static method to compare two rectangle instances based on their area, determining which rectangle is larger.

#### 9. A Square is a Rectangle

Implemented a class method to create square instances, reinforcing the relationship between squares and rectangles within the class structure.
